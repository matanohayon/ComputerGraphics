to do from hw2:

-world space/view space transformations via button: Tomer VVVV
all we need to change is if the world button is clicked, apply transformation without translating to the 0,0 and back.

-prespective matrix: Matan
todo

-tessellation bug: Matan 
slider resets on new scene, change it

-normal calculate for all vertices: Tomer VVVVV
update the datastructure to have normalFromFIle, and normalCalculated
in the store data function, compute normals for all vertices, and all polygons
later in the onDraw, address the flags and draw the right onesa. 

polygon normals: Tomer VVVVVV
same as the last point.


hw3 tasks:

scan conversion: Tomer VVVVVV
ask in discord how to interpolate colors inside polygons as it seems that the colors of the vertices are always similar
interpolate normals? is it needed? very difficult to look at a lot of normals inside 1 poly
fill the polygons with points which have color, normal, depth 
properties via interpolations from .

z buffer: VVVVVV
maintain a scene's z buffer which, for each pixel, 
hides the backward surface and shows the front pixel.

light calculation: Matan 

silhouette highlighting: Matan
update the ds to have a list of vertices, each one points at 2 polygons, each poly has a front/back normal
then you can highlight silouets


flip all normals: Tomer VVVVV

background image: Tomer VVVVV
